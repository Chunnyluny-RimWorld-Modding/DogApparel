## Description

_Hey there, fellow RimWorld enthusiasts! I'm the creator behind the Dog Apparel mod!_

_Dog Apparel brings some awesome new stuff to [RimWorld mod](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Mods) for the [Ludeon Studios](https://ludeon.com/) game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/). Please see the [Acknowledgement section](#acknowledgement) below for important information._

This mod should make life on the Rim more fun by adding support dogs for pawns who need assistance. Support dogs are trained to help disabled pawns. My idea was to let dogs play a big role in the story. These dogs are trained to assist with things like spotting dangers, fetching stuff, and solving mysteries. My idea was inspired by Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes for the detective theme.
An additional research option will be introduced under the "Advanced Trainability" category called "support dogs".

_“Just a heads-up, I'm still learning to use GitHub and coding stuff. I hope you can enjoy this mod as I enjoy making it for you”._

Support Dogs

- Boost gameplay with support dogs that assist disabled pawns.
- Train them via the "Support Dog Training" research, to better follow their owners, to protect them.

Dog Detectives

- These furry pals can wear detective gear for a fun twist in your stories.
- Twinning is winning, match your dog with their owner, by equipping them both with a detective outfit
- The outfit includes a detective coat with matching hat, you can also equip your pawn with a magnifying glass.
- This feature is for roleplaying reasons and has no add
equipping your dog with a detective outfit.
- Use animal footprints or pawprints as detective props and decor

K9 Military Dogs

- Improve your military missions with K9 Military Dogs trained to spot bombs.
- Equip these protective apparel on your dogs and ensure security during military missions.

Research

Add "Support Dog Training" as a new research project. This research will allow pawns to assign tasks to their support dogs, such as danger detection or item retrieving.

Required mod dependency: [Animal Gear](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541438907)

## Canine Safety Alert System

Inspired by the protective principles of Rimmunation clothing, I present an innovative concept: a specialized dog gear designed to contribute significantly to the colony's safety. This idea revolves around harnessing dogs as active safety allies within the colony.

Imagine a practical vest or harness, expertly crafted for canine comfort. Drawing from the ingenuity of bomb suits, this adaptation focuses on improving safety standards. Incorporated within the gear is a sensor calibrated to detect potential hazards like explosives and EMPs. Ahead of triggering, the sensor initiates an alert, sounding a warning akin to the familiar sound of a household smoke detector.

Imagine a scenario where a dog, wears this danger detecting gear, roams the colony grounds. As the dog comes within proximity of danger, the sensor is activated, producing a distinct sound that echoes the early stages of a potential threat. This clever idea makes the colony more alert and strategic when facing enemy raids.

This security system will be called "Canine Safety Alert System." the advanced dogs are trained to encounter danger without getting hurt. The colony gains a trusted partner in maintaining safety.

## FAQ

### Can I add this mod to an ungoing save game?

Yes but you need to enable the items first, so the pawns can interact with them; be aware any mod that adds new items, such as food, drugs, and clothing, is automatically disabled in stockpiles. Colonists will ignore them, and they will not haul or wear the item. When you just added this mod, the items are not automatically included in the stockpiles or recipes. This is not considered a bug or an error. You just need to tick them on for recipes or stockpiles etc. After you enable them, they will show up.

### Can I remove this mod from a save game?

I wouldn't advise it, as a general rule. If you really want to, start by backing up your saves, then get rid of all the mod-added items in your game and make sure none of your pawns/colony animals are wearing any apparel. No apparel is made at the tailor table etc. Make sure they are not stored in stockpiles, and pawns are not training animals, cancel any research related to this mod. Then you can try removing the mod. But I can't promise to help you if this breaks your save. That's what the backup is for.

### Any requirement(s) for this mod to work?

Yes this mod is created to use the [Animal Gear](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541438907). You should also use a mod manager like [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases) or [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort)
They make sure you load this mod in the right place. You can find more information about these mod managers in my [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/troubleshootingguide/README.md).

### Combat Extended compatible?

I have not made a patch to support Combat Extended, because I don't use [Combat Extended](https://github.com/CombatExtended-Continued/CombatExtended) myself.
If you use Combat Extended in your modlist and have more info about regarding the compatibility, please share your experience with both mods enabled.

### Can I use this mod with any other mod(s)?

You can try out for yourself, I have included textures, if you are using Vanilla Animals Expanded. I have checked before if there is any mod existing on the workshop that would would add the same items/features as my mod. I have not found anything similar, so I assume it is quite rare to get any mod conflict. ```Place the 'Animal Gear' mod before this mod in the load order for proper functionality.``` If you do run into an incompatibility of any kind, though, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/DogApparel/issues/new)

### Steam or GitHub and when available for release?

This mod is still in development and will be released on Github when it is almost content ready. Since this mod is a collab. it will be expanded upon. Because this is my first ever RimWorld mod, I appreciate any feedback or bugreports, you can place them in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/DogApparel/issues/new). I will prefer updating this mod on GitHub, since it is easier to implement new features and bugfixes through GitHub. When any Alpha version is ready to test out, feel free to star this repository to keep up-to-date and provide me with any feedback on functionality of this mod.
