# RimWorld mod: Dog utility

This mod will add a new feature where pets will support you when your pawns are disabled, sitting in a wheelchair or are deaf/blind. It will require research which will be put as support dog training.
This mod is going to require animal gear and animal equipment to work.
The idea came from Octogiraffe, when he was asking for features and how to implement ideas related to an Ukrainian dog. 24-6-2023 Octogiraffe agreed to my suggestions about dog harnesses on the Rim. "Any clue how the harness would tie into finding bombs? Still gonna make it anyway, but I want to see if I can squeeze that detail into actual gameplay, that will require: animal gear and animal equipment".
The idea for a Danger-detecting Dog suit/vest was born.

- Concept idea; danger detecting dog suit/vest: Rimmunation clothing adds bombsuits, belts/gear which are worn on the utility slot. Animal gear and animal equipment add utility slot and belt slot to animals so they can wear shieldbelts to protect themselves. My idea was to implement the bomb/EMP detector into a dog harness which will trigger an alert if there is danger nearby, to warn others.
- Dog bulletproof vest
- Dog bulletproof vest with guarddog printed on it
- Bombsuit for dogs (inspired by Rimmunation clothes2 by Chickenplucker)
- Detects IEDs in enemy bases.
- Additional functions to dig up truffles and drugs, the animal forage mod has a similar feature, which we will try to implement if necessary.
(I need to copy the line where each animal get flagged to forage specific food. animal base â†’ item that will be foraged/spawned)
- This feature could could also detect illegal amounts of smokeleaf, luciferium or go-juice, which than will be confescated by security.
- Additional feature: add animal footprints, pawprints that pawn follow to solve a mystery. This feature will add a cosmetic detective coat with matching detective hat for dogs. Tags: Protective support, dogtective, dogutility, animalgear, animalequipment.
