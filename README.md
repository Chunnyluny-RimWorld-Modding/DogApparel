Protective supportive dogtective.
I was thinking, it would be more like support dogs, when you are disabled/wheelchaired,deaf/blind 

Idea for Danger-detecting Doggo Harness D-DH 24-6-2023 (collab) Octogiraffe: I like this idea, and it means I shouldn't have to patch stuff as much if I use the animal equipment/gear framework! Any clue how the harness would tie into finding bombs? Still gonna make it anyway but I want to see if I can squeeze that detail into actual gameplay that will requires: animal equipment and animal gear mods to work. Adds Danger-detecting Doggo harness. 
Concept: Rimmunation clothing adds belts/gear that is in the utility slot, not sure if animal gear has functional slots. I want the bomb/EMP detector to be implemented in the dog harness and will emit an alarm sound to warn others. Idk we will look for any sound sample that is short enough to put it in there. Likely needs to be an .ogg format. Detects IEDs in enemy bases. Additional functions to dig up truffles and drugs would also be nice. Idk, but the mod animal forage has the same concept. It is noted as an animal base â†’ item it will forage/spawn. It could also trigger drugs like cocaine and heroin/smokeleaf. We can also add the idea of animal footprints,pawprints. Something like a detective dog with a detective outfit with a detective hat.
