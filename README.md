## Description

*Hey there, fellow RimWorld enthusiasts! I'm the creator behind the Dog Apparel mod!*

*Dog Apparel brings some awesome new stuff to [RimWorld mod](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Mods) for the [Ludeon Studios](https://ludeon.com/) game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/). Please see the [Acknowledgement section](#acknowledgement) below for important information.*

This mod should make life on the Rim more fun by adding support dogs for pawns who need assistance. Support dogs are trained to help disabled pawns. My idea was to let dogs play a big role in the story. These dogs are trained to assist with things like spotting dangers, fetching stuff, and solving mysteries. My idea was based on Scooby Doo and Sherlock Holmes.
An additional research option will be introduced under the "Advanced Trainability" category called "support dogs".

*"Just a heads up, I'm still learning to use GitHub and coding stuff. I hope you can understand and but at the same time can enjoy this mod as I enjoy making it for you".*

Support Dogs

- Boost gameplay with support dogs that assist disabled pawns.
- Train them via the "Support Dog Training" research, forming close pawn-dog bonds. So they will follow their owners, to protect them.

Dog Detectives

- Dive into playful roleplay with Dog Detectives, like Scooby-Doo and sherlock style.
- These furry pals can wear detective gear for a fun twist in your stories.
- Add a matching outfit for pawns including detective coat and matching hat, and don't forget the magnifying glass.

Mystery-Solving

- Implement animal footprints or pawprints as a clue for pawns to follow and solve mysteries. (optional)
This feature is for roleplaying reasons and has no additional function rather than equiping your dog with a detective outfit.

K9 Military Dogs

- Basic dog gear like harnesses, vests, and bomb suits inspired by [[RH2] Rimmu-NationÂ² - Clothing](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2563506048)
- Improve your military missions with K9 Military Dogs trained to spot bombs.
- Equip them on your dogs and ensure security during military missions.

Research
Add "Support Dog Training" as a new research project.
This research will allow pable pawns to assign tasks to their support dogs, such as danger detection or item fetching.

Required mods [Animal Gear](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541438907) and [Animal Equipment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2568865984)

## Canine Safety Alert System

Inspired by the protective principles of Rimmunation clothing, I present an innovative concept: a specialized dog gear designed to contribute significantly to the colony's safety. This idea revolves around harnessing dogs as active safety allies within the colony.

Imagine a practical vest or harness, expertly crafted for canine comfort. Drawing from the ingenuity of bombsuits, this adaptation focuses on improving safety standards. Incorporated within the gear is a sensor calibrated to detect potential hazards like explosives and EMPs. Ahead of triggering, the sensor initiates an alert, sounding a warning akin to the familiar sound of a household smoke detector.

Imagine a scenario where a dog, wears this danger detecting gear, roams the colony grounds. As the dog comes within proximity of danger, the sensor is activated, producing a distinct sound that echoes the early stages of a potential threat. This clever idea makes the colony more alert and strategic when facing enemy raids.

This security system will be called "Canine Safety Alert System." the advanced dogs are trained to encounter danger without getting hurt. The colony gains a trusted partner in maintaining safety.

## FAQ

### Can I add this mod to a save game?

Yes. No problem. You need to enable the items first so the pawns can interact with them; be aware any mod that adds new items, such as food, drugs, and clothing, is automatically disabled in stockpiles. Colonists will ignore them, and they will not haul or wear the item. When you just added this mod, the items are not automatically included in the stockpiles or recipes. This is not considered a bug or an error. You just need to tick them on for recipes or stockpiles etc. After you enable them, they will show up.

### Can I remove this mod from a save game?

I wouldn't advise it, as a general rule. If you really want to, start by backing up your saves, then get rid of all the mod-added items in your game and make sure none of your pawns/colony animals are wearing any apparel. No apparel is made at the tailor table etc. Make sure they are not stored in stockpiles, and pawns are not training animals, cancel any research related to this mod. Then you can try removing the mod. But I can't promise to help you if this breaks your save. That's what the backup is for.

### Any requirements for this mod to work?

Yes, you need [Animal Gear](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541438907) this mod is created to use the animal gear framework. Also recommended and required: [Animal Equipment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2568865984).

It is recommmended to use a mod manager like [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases) or [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort) to install this mod. They are recommended and will help loading the mod in the correct order. These mod managers are more explained in details on my [Troubleshootingguide](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/troubleshootingguide/README.md). More information about this mod is found on [About.xml](DogApparel/About/About.xml)

### Combat Extended compatible?

Why wouldn't it be? I don't want to use [Combat Extended](https://github.com/CombatExtended-Continued/CombatExtended) because it doesn't work well with most of the mods I like. If you use Combat Extended and have info on mod compatibility, share your experience using both mods.

### Can I use this mod with [any other mods]?

Sure it will be possible. It's extremely unlikely for there to be any conflict between DogApparel any other mod. It is supposed to work with animalgear and animal equipment mod, they are required to get this mod work. If you do run into an incompatibility of any kind, though, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/DogApparel/issues/new)

### Steam or GitHub?

This mod is still in development and will be pre-released on Github before it is available on the SteamWorkshop, since I don't own RimWorld on Steam I can't upload it to the RimWorld workshop page.
