# RimWorld mod: Dog utility

The Dog Utility mod enhances gameplay in RimWorld by introducing dogs as supportive companions to disabled or impaired pawns. These dogs are trained to assist their owners in various tasks, including danger detection, item retrieval, and solving mysteries. Players will need to research and equip their dogs with specialized gear and equipment to utilize these features effectively.

Feature: Support Dogs
- Dogs provide assistance to disabled, wheelchair-bound, deaf, or blind pawns.
- Support dogs require training through the "Support Dog Training" research.

**Required mods: animal gear and animal equipment to work.**

Animal gear and animal equipment mod are required to implement their framework so dogs can perform specific tasks.
Concept idea; danger detecting dog suit/vest: inspiration from Rimmunation clothing which adds bombsuits for humanoid pawns.
The belts/gear will be worn on the utility slot. 
My idea was to implement the bomb/EMP detector into a dog harness which will trigger an alert if there is danger nearby, to warn others. Implement proximity-based danger detection for dogs wearing the bomb suit. Dogs trigger alerts to warn nearby pawns of potential dangers.
The idea for a Danger-detecting Dog suit/vest was born.

Features for dog equipment: 
This mod will add:
- Harnesses, bulletproof vests, and bomb suits that can be equipped on dogs.
- Bombsuit for dogs (inspired by Rimmunation clothes2 by Chickenplucker)

Features including: animal foraging and drug detecting. 
- Implement a flagging system to identify specific items for dogs to forage or detect.
- Dogs can locate truffles, drugs, and illegal substances like smokeleaf, luciferium or go-juice, which than will be gathered for security reasons.
- Dogs can wear danger-detecting suits that detect IEDs in enemy bases.
   
**Mystery-Solving:**

- Implement animal footprints or pawprints as a clue for pawns to follow and solve mysteries.
Introduce a cosmetic detective coat and detective hat for dogs.
This will be for roleplaying:
This feature will add a cosmetic detective coat with matching detective hat for dogs. 
This feature is for roleplaying reasons and has no additional function rather than equiping your dog with a detective outfit.

Research: Add "Support Dog Training" as a new research project.
New Jobtoil: Task assignment for pawns: Enable pawns to assign tasks to their support dogs, such as danger detection or item retrieval.
