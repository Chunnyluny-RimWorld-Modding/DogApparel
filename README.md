RimWorld mod for dogutility

**RimWorld mod for dog utility**
*A collab featuring Octogiraffe*
This mod turns your furbaby (dog) into a support dog. This will be usefull when pawns are disabled or being in a wheelchair (need wheelchair mod) Also very convenient when your pawns are deaf or blind. The mod adds advanced training which needs to be researched first. It will be listed under advanced trainability-supportdog. This mod is going to require animal gear and animal equipment to work. The idea came from Octogiraffe, when he was asking for features and how to implement ideas related to an Ukrainian dog. 24-6-2023 Octogiraffe agreed to my suggestions about dog harnesses on the Rim. Any clue how the harness would tie into finding bombs? Still gonna make it anyway but I want to see, if I can squeeze that detail into actual gameplay, that will requires: animal gear and animal equipment mods to work.
Idea for Danger-detecting Doggo Harness. Adds Danger-detecting Doggo harness. Concept: Rimmunation clothing adds bombsuits, belts/gear which are equiped on the utility slot, not sure if animal gear has utility slot as human pawns. I want the bomb/EMP detector to be implemented in the dog harness. It will also Detect IEDs in enemy base. When equiped by the dog, it will sound an alert to warn others for nearby danger. I have found the perfct sound sample in .ogg format. Additional functions to dig up truffles and drugs would also be nice. The mod animal forage has similar features. animal base â†’ item it will forage/spawn. It could also trigger drugs like cocaine and heroin/smokeleaf. We can also add animal footprints,pawprints as activity it will be grouped under animal recognizing. A dog that will wear a detective outfit with a detective hat would be fun as well to add into this mod. Tags: Protective support, dogtective, dogutility, animalgear, animalequipment.
